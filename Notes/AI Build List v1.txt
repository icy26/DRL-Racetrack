AI research & self teaching

    Differentiate between supervised learning & reinforcement learning
        Supervised learning - learning by example
            Here are examples. Learn patterns from these examples

        Reinforcement learning - learning by experience
            Here is an environment. Learn patterns by exploring it

    Understand deep reinforcement learning technique(s) will be needed for this implementation
