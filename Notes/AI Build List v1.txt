Notes
    How to provide a reward without the agent needing to be finished for faster more effective training
        Reason
            Model in current build will only receive a reward for finishing,
            so until it finishes it won't know what its doing correct and will most likely never finish
            By providing a secondary reward for every run, the model can adjust for every training iteration
        Possible Fixes (Form of secondary reward)
            Time on track
                The longer the agent stays on track the larger reward it will receive.
                Problem here is it will learn to just no move until score zeros out to get max reward
            Distance traveled
                The further the agent travels the larger reward received
                This is better as the model will strive for the agent to move further along the track with every iteration
                Problem may include, agent cheating the system by going back and forth as direction of distance is not implied
                Hope that naturally agent can get higher score by only moving along track rather than moving along a straight
                doing a 180 and going back as score will zero out eventually
        More
            Secondary score should be weighted less than finishing as finishing is the primary goal
