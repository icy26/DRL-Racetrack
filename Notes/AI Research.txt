AI research & self teaching

    Differentiate between supervised learning & reinforcement learning
        Supervised learning - learning by example
            Here are examples. Learn patterns from these examples

        Reinforcement learning - learning by experience
            Here is an environment. Learn patterns by exploring it

    Understand deep reinforcement learning technique(s) will be needed for this implementation

    Exploration vs. Exploitation Problem
        Exploration - An agent that continues to look for higher rewarding combinations/options
        Exploitation - An agent that determines best reward option quickly and sticks with it
        Problem - With exploration an agent will never stick with the highest possible rewards and missed out as it constantly looking for better
                    With exploitation an agent won't check all of its options and sticks to what it thinks is best. May be better alternatives available
        A compromise between the 2 is required
