Original approach for Simple MLP (Multilayer Perceptron - Deep Neural Network) scratched

Approach
    A reinforcement learning algorithm known as Q-Learning to be implemented with a deep neural network - Known as a DQN (Deep Q-Network)

Basics
    Reinforcement Learning - An model that has access to the agents state (inputs) and actions (outputs)
                            Based on the state the model must determine the best action for the agent in order to receive a reward
                            Rewards lead to the agent choosing the action more frequently and an action leading to no reward deters the agent
                            from making that action in the future

NN Short List
    Neural Network Architecture (TensorFlow equiv - Model.add) -  DONE
        Simple Deep NN. Inputs, 2 x hidden layer, output (9 options)
        Activation functions
        Forward Prop

    Normalise Data
        Method to normalise inputs accordingly

    Train functions (TensorFlow equiv - Model.Fit)
        Calc Loss
        Backprop
        Grad Desc

    Model.Fit is called at every state in 'crazy model'
