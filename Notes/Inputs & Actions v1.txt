Each state will consist of 4 inputs
    Agent Position (mid point of agent) - (float,float)
    Speed (velocity) - int (0-top speed of agent)
    Direction (steering angle)- int (0-359)
    Distance to borders (contours) - float)

How do I use these values as inputs to the model?

Action space
    2 variables will be changed. Speed and direction
    They can also only be changed by the set amount respectively
        Speed
            Speed up
            Slow down
            Do nothing
        Direction
            Turn left
            Turn right
            Do nothing
